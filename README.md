# TensorFlow Keras Model - Exploratory Analysis

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building process using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

This project involves:
- Building a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Training the model on a simple dataset
- Evaluating the model performance
- Making predictions with the trained model

## Dataset

The dataset used consists of binary input pairs with a corresponding binary target. It is designed to demonstrate a basic neural network's capabilities.

## Notebooks

1. `Tensorflow_Keras_Model.ipynb`: This notebook includes the entire workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation and prediction.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow
